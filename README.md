# ScriptHub

<h3>DevOps Marketplace</h3>
<p>A bespoke shop for hand crafted scripts</p>

<h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
<p>DevOps requires custom solutions for their operational environment.When there isn't a marketplace for your unique problem, it is best to look to fellow engineers for custom solutions. ScriptHub allows DevOps engineers to advertise jobs or take on micro-contracts, allowing for focus on core responsibilities. Have the power of an entire team at the fraction of the cost.</p>

<h3>Blockchain:</h3>
<p>Blockchain will be used to enable secure data transactions for micro-contracts. It will also be utilized for smart contracts, to manage access for leased material/data.</p>
